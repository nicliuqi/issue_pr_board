# The file supports notifying receivers through email when an issue is created.
# You catn define a series of SIGs or repositories to notify, each of them contains fields "name" and "receivers",
# the name should be the name of the SIG/repository, and the receivers should be a list of email address.
#
# If you want to follow a new issue of a SIG created by QuickIssue, the following is an example
#
# sigs:
#   - name: Infrastructure
#     receivers:
#       - receiver1@aaa
#       - receiver2@bbb
#       - receiver3@ccc
#
# Or maybe you just want to follow some repositories, you could config them like
#
# repos:
#   - name: openeuler/infrastructure
#     receivers:
#       - receiver1@aaa
#       - receiver2@bbb
#       - receiver3@ccc
#   - name: src-openeuler/kernel
#     receivers:
#       - receiver1@aaa
#       - receiver2@bbb
#       - receiver3@ccc
